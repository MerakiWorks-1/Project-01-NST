## Styling & Theming

- **Tailwind CSS** is configured with a custom design system (see `src/index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`).
- **Dark mode** is supported via the `class` strategy.
- **Design tokens** (colors, gradients, shadows, etc.) are defined as CSS variables for easy theming.

---

## Routing

All major sections are routed via `react-router-dom` and code-split for performance. The main routes include:

- `/` (Home)
- `/academics`
- `/campus`
- `/clubs`
- `/events`
- `/mentors`
- `/startups`
- `/internships`
- `/support`
- `/admissions`
- `*` (404 Not Found)

---
